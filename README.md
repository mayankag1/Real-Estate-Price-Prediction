# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
In this project, we are analyzing the real estate valuation data.<br> <br>
Using this dataset, we are trying to predict the house price based on a number of factors. 
We will compare different Regression models and test their performance.
In the first part of this project,we perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the predictors and how they affect the house price.
We look at their numerical and graphical summaries. <br> <br>
Next we will use different Regression models to create two prediction models. 
The models will be based on Multiple Linear Regression, Smoothing Splines and Random Forests. 
To train our models, we split the dataset into a training and testing set. 
The first prediction model we use is Multiple Linear Regression, while the second model is a Smoothing splines model. 
We compare these models on a testing set and compare the prediction errors.
Another non-parametric prediction model, Random Forest, is also used to predict, and the results are compared with the previous models.<br><br>
While implementing the prediction models we perform several methods for variable selection and model diagnostics.
